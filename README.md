# Churn-Analysis
The project aims to predict customer churn, which refers to the likelihood of customers discontinuing a particular telecom service. Predicting churn can help businesses take proactive measures to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.

In this repository, we have performed the end to end Exploratory Data Analysis, and idenfitied the characteristics of the customers that are more likely to churn.
